# PRD: Contact Form Email Notification System

## Executive Summary

Enhance the existing contact form on The Profit Platform website to provide immediate email notifications when customers submit inquiries. The system will ensure no leads are missed, provide instant acknowledgment to prospects, and create a seamless communication workflow for business growth.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
- The existing contact form uses Formspree but lacks comprehensive email notification setup
- Business owner needs immediate alerts when high-value marketing audit requests come in
- Prospects expect instant confirmation that their inquiry was received
- No automated follow-up sequence to nurture leads while awaiting personal response

**Why is this important now?**
- Form is positioned as the primary lead generation tool ($997 value marketing audit)
- 24-hour response guarantee requires immediate notification system
- Missing a single qualified lead could cost $1,000+ in potential revenue
- Professional presentation requires automated confirmation emails

## User Stories
