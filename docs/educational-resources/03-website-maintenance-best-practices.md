## 1. Why Website Maintenance Matters

### The Cost of Neglect

#### Security Risks
- **Hacking attempts**: 30,000+ websites hacked daily
- **Malware infections**: Can destroy SEO rankings
- **Data breaches**: Legal liability and reputation damage
- **Blacklisting**: Google blocks 10,000+ sites daily

#### Performance Degradation
- **Speed decline**: 1-second delay = 7% conversion loss
- **Broken features**: Lost sales and frustrated users
- **Outdated content**: Damages credibility

#### SEO Impact
- **Ranking drops**: Google penalizes slow, insecure sites

### Return on Maintenance Investment
