## General Digital Marketing

### Q: What is digital marketing and why do I need it?

**A:** Digital marketing encompasses all marketing efforts that use the internet or electronic devices. You need it because:
- 97% of consumers search online for local businesses
- Your competitors are already online
- It's measurable and cost-effective
- It works 24/7, even while you sleep
- It levels the playing field with larger competitors

### Q: How is digital marketing different from traditional marketing?

**A:** Key differences include:
- **Measurability**: Track every click, call, and conversion
- **Targeting**: Reach exactly who needs your services
- **Cost**: Generally more affordable with better ROI
- **Speed**: Launch campaigns in hours, not weeks
- **Flexibility**: Adjust strategies in real-time
- **Interaction**: Two-way communication with customers

### Q: What digital marketing services do I really need?

**A:** It depends on your business, but most Sydney businesses benefit from:
1. **SEO**: For long-term, sustainable growth
2. **Google Ads**: For immediate visibility and leads
3. **Website Optimization**: To convert visitors into customers
4. **Google Business Profile**: Essential for local visibility

Start with one service and expand based on results and budget.

### Q: How much should a small business spend on digital marketing?

**A:** Industry guidelines suggest 7-10% of gross revenue for growth, 5-7% for maintenance. However, for small businesses:
- **Startup phase**: $1,000-3,000/month
- **Growth phase**: $2,000-5,000/month
- **Scale phase**: 7-10% of revenue

Start with what you can afford consistently, then scale based on ROI.

### Q: Can I do digital marketing myself?

**A:** Yes, but consider:
- **Time investment**: 15-20 hours/week minimum
- **Learning curve**: 6-12 months to become proficient
- **Opportunity cost**: Time away from running your business
- **Risk of mistakes**: Can damage rankings or waste budget
- **Keeping current**: Constant algorithm changes

Most business owners find hiring experts provides better ROI.

## SEO Questions

### Q: What exactly is SEO?

**A:** SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving your website to rank higher in Google's organic (unpaid) search results. It involves:
- Technical optimization (site speed, mobile-friendliness)
- Content creation (valuable information for users)
- Keyword targeting (what customers search for)
- Link building (other sites vouching for you)
- Local optimization (appearing in map results)

### Q: How long does SEO take to work?

**A:** Typical SEO timeline:
- **Month 1-3**: Foundation building, initial improvements
- **Month 4-6**: Noticeable traffic increases, ranking improvements
- **Month 6-12**: Significant growth, competitive rankings
- **Year 2+**: Compound growth, market dominance

Factors affecting timeline: Competition level, current site status, budget, content quality.

### Q: Why is SEO so expensive?

**A:** Quality SEO requires:
- **Expertise**: Years of experience and ongoing education
- **Time**: 20-40 hours/month of specialized work
- **Tools**: $500-1000/month in professional software
- **Content**: Creating valuable, optimized content
- **Monitoring**: Daily tracking and adjustments

Cheap SEO often uses harmful tactics that damage your business long-term.

### Q: What's the difference between local SEO and regular SEO?

**A:**
**Local SEO** focuses on:
- "Near me" searches
- Google Map rankings
- Local directories
- Location-specific content
- Google Business Profile optimization

**Regular SEO** targets:
- Broader geographic areas
- National/international visibility
- Industry-wide keywords
- Informational content

Most Sydney businesses need both, with emphasis on local.

### Q: Can you guarantee #1 rankings?

**A:** No ethical SEO company guarantees specific rankings because:
- Google's algorithm has 200+ ranking factors
- Competition constantly changes
- Google updates algorithms regularly
- Rankings vary by location and user

We guarantee to improve your visibility and use proven strategies, but specific positions can't be guaranteed.

### Q: What happens if I stop SEO?

**A:** Stopping SEO leads to:
- **Immediate**: No new optimizations or content
- **1-3 months**: Rankings begin to slip
- **3-6 months**: Competitors overtake positions
- **6-12 months**: Significant traffic loss
- **Long-term**: Return to pre-SEO levels or worse

SEO is an investment in long-term growth, not a one-time fix.

## Google Ads Questions

### Q: How do Google Ads work?

**A:** Google Ads operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) auction system:
1. You choose keywords related to your business
2. Create ads that appear when people search those keywords
3. Set a maximum bid you'll pay per click
4. Only pay when someone clicks your ad
5. Your ad position depends on bid amount and quality score

### Q: What's a good budget for Google Ads?

**A:** Minimum effective budgets:
- **Local service business**: $1,000-2,000/month
- **E-commerce**: $2,000-5,000/month
- **B2B services**: $2,000-4,000/month
- **Competitive industries**: $3,000-10,000/month

Calculate your budget: (Desired leads × Cost per click × Conversion rate)

### Q: How quickly will I see results from Google Ads?

**A:** Google Ads timeline:
- **Day 1**: Ads go live, immediate visibility
- **Week 1**: Initial data gathering
- **Week 2-4**: Optimization based on data
- **Month 2**: Refined targeting and improved ROI
- **Month 3+**: Scaled success and consistent results

Unlike SEO, Google Ads provides immediate visibility but requires optimization for best ROI.

### Q: What's the difference between Google Ads and Facebook Ads?

**A:**
**Google Ads**:
- Intent-based (people actively searching)
- Higher conversion rates
- More expensive per click
- B2B and urgent needs excel

**Facebook Ads**:
- Interest-based (interruption marketing)
- Lower cost per thousand impressions
- Better for brand awareness
- B2C and visual products excel

Most businesses benefit from both platforms.

### Q: Why did my Google Ads stop working?

**A:** Common reasons:
- Increased competition driving up costs
- Ad fatigue (same ads too long)
- Seasonal changes in demand
- Landing page issues
- Tracking problems
- Account suspended for policy violations
- Budget exhaustion
- Quality Score declined

Regular optimization prevents most issues.
