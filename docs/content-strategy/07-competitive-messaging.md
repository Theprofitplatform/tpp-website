# Comparison Messaging vs Traditional Agencies

## Core Differentiation Strategy

### The "Hungry New Agency" Positioning

**Our Advantage:** Fresh, motivated, and focused
**Their Weakness:** Complacent, bureaucratic, and overwhelmed

**Key Message:** "While big agencies treat you like client #247, we treat you like our most important partnership."

### Problem 3: Hidden Costs & Poor Communication
**Traditional Agency Issues:**
- Setup fees, management fees, hidden costs
