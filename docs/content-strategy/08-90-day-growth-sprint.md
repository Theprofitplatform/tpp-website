# 90-Day Growth Sprint Visualization & Explanation

## The 90-Day Growth Sprint Framework

### Core Concept
**"From Strategy to Domination in 90 Days"**

The 90-Day Growth Sprint is The Profit Platform's signature methodology that takes Sydney businesses from marketing uncertainty to market domination in exactly 90 days. Unlike traditional agencies that promise vague "long-term growth," we deliver measurable results within a specific timeframe.
