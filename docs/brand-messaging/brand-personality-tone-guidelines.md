## Consistency Checkpoints

Before any communication goes out, ask:

1. **Is it transparent?** Would we be comfortable sharing this with our toughest critic?
2. **Is it helpful?** Does this genuinely help the reader understand or make better decisions?
3. **Is it credible?** Can we back up every claim with specific evidence?
4. **Is it clear?** Would someone outside our industry understand this?
5. **Does it sound like us?** Is this how our best team member would explain it face-to-face?

## Implementation Notes

- Every piece of content should reflect at least 2-3 of our core personality traits
- When in doubt, err on the side of more transparency and specificity
- Our tone should differentiate us from both "corporate" agencies and "casual" freelancers
- Regularly audit communications to ensure consistency across all touchpoints
