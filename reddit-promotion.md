# Reddit Promotion (Value-First Approach)

## Target Subreddits:
- r/smallbusiness
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/marketing
- r/SEO
- r/PPC
- r/AusSmallBusiness

## Approach:
1. Answer questions with genuine value
2. Mention tools only when directly relevant
3. Focus on helping first, promoting second

## Example:
"I run a digital agency and we use a 47-point SEO checklist for all clients. Happy to share it if helpful - it's what we use for enterprise clients but works for any size business."
