## 4. Technical Implementation

### Solution Applied
1. Created symbolic links from `.html` files to their respective `directory/index.html` files
2. Updated nginx configuration to handle both `.html` and directory URLs
3. Maintained compatibility with existing JavaScript navigation that uses `.html` extensions

### Files Created
- Symbolic links for all main pages (about.html â†’ about/index.html, etc.)
- Updated nginx configuration with proper try_files directive

## 5. Browser Compatibility
The site works correctly with:
- Direct URL access (typing URLs)
- Navigation menu clicks
- Both `.html` and directory-style URLs

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - All navigation links are working correctly

## Access URLs
- **Live Site**: http://new.theprofitplatform.com.au
- **Test any page**: http://new.theprofitplatform.com.au/[page].html

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Update JavaScript to use directory URLs instead of `.html` extensions
2. Implement 301 redirects from `.html` to clean URLs
3. Add SSL certificate for HTTPS
4. Set up monitoring and analytics
