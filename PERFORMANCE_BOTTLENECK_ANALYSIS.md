## Identified Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. **Sequential Processing Bottleneck**
**Impact:** High | **Priority:** Critical
- **Issue:** Performance tests run sequentially rather than parallel
- **Root Cause:** Single-threaded test execution limiting throughput
- **Symptoms:** Extended test suite execution time
- **Recommendation:** Implement worker threads for parallel test execution

### 2. **Memory Monitoring Overhead**
**Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** High
- **Issue:** 10-second interval memory monitoring may cause performance hiccups
- **Root Cause:** Synchronous memory checks blocking main thread
- **Symptoms:** Potential micro-stalls in user interaction
- **Recommendation:** Move memory monitoring to Web Worker

### 3. **Resource Bundle Loading**
**Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** High
- **Issue:** Despite optimization, bundle loading still sequential
- **Root Cause:** HTTP/1.1 request queuing and lack of HTTP/2 push
- **Symptoms:** Waterfall loading pattern
- **Recommendation:** Implement HTTP/2 server push and preload strategies

### 4. **Lazy Loading Implementation Gap**
**Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** Medium
- **Issue:** Lazy loading only checks `isBelowFold` at initialization
- **Root Cause:** No dynamic viewport consideration for responsive layouts
- **Symptoms:** Premature loading on smaller screens
- **Recommendation:** Dynamic lazy loading thresholds

### 5. **Performance Observer Memory Leaks**
**Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** Medium
- **Issue:** Observers not properly cleaned up in SPA navigation
- **Root Cause:** No cleanup on page transitions
- **Symptoms:** Growing memory usage over time
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper observer lifecycle management
