## üí° RECOMMENDATION

**The project has made significant progress** with the Astro migration now complete. However, **production readiness is blocked** by build errors and incomplete consolidation.

**Critical Path:**

2. Complete CSS consolidation (2 hours)
3. Clean up Python scripts (1 hour)
4. Deploy to production (1 hour)

**Total time to production: ~5 hours**

## üìà TREND

**Positive:** Major progress on migration
**Negative:** Technical debt still growing
**Overall:** Moving in right direction but needs focused cleanup
