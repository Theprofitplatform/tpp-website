Overview
--------

Program to plot the response to variations in a set of one or more controllers.
Optionally, a postscript file can be generated of the plot.
Optionally, a table of the response can be generated.

A controller is a Bmad Group, Overlay, Girder, or Ramper element.
The "response" is either controller slave values or the RF voltage or RF potential. 
Plotting is expecially useful for controllers that use knot points to define the slave functions.

Example. In the lattice file:
  ov: overlay = {q1[k1]:t^2}, var = {t}
In this example, the response when varying the controller variable "t" of the slave parameter q1[k1]
is the quadratic t^2.


Running
-------

On the command line:
  > controller_response_plot {param-file-name}

The file param-file-name sets parameters used by the program.
If param-file-name is not specified, the default is:
  controller_response_plot.init

There are two examples in the directory (relative to a Bmad Distribution or Release):
  util_programs/controller_response_plot/example1
  util_programs/controller_response_plot/example2

Note: If a postscript file is generated, to generate a pdf file after running the program, use
the ps2pdf program.


Input parameters
----------------

See the controller_response_plot.init files in the examples for documentation on the input parameters.
