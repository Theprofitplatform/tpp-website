Lattice Translation from Accelerator Toolkit to Bmad format

Note: Translation is only good for simple lattices. Better is to convert to MAD and then convert MAD to Bmad.

Syntax:
  accelerator_toolkit_to_bmad <at_file_name> {<bmad_file_name>}
Default:
  <bmad_file_name> = <at_file_name>.bmad  # If <at_file_name> has ending ".at" this will be stripped.

Notes:
* Lines that cannot be translated will appear with a "???" prefix in the output file.
