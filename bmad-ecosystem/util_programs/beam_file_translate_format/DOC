beam_file_translate_format program
----------------------------------

Program to translate between different beam file formats.

Beam files are files containing the positions of particles in a beam.
Beam files are produced, for example, when using the "write beam" command of Tao.

Usage:
  beam_file_translate_format <beam_file> <out_format> <lat_file>

where:
<beam_file>  = Name of input beam file.

<out_format> is one of:
  ascii     ! ASCII file format
  hdf5      ! HDF5 format

<lat_file> Optional lattice file. Possibly needed with hdf5 format input.

-------------------------------------

The input beam file format will be determined by the program. 

If the input beam file name has a .init suffix, the input file is a namelist block out of which a
beam is formed using a beam_init_struct structure. See the Bmad manual for details about the
beam_init_struct structure. Example namelist block:

&param
	lat_file = "lattice-file-name"  !
	ele_name = "Name-or-index-of-element-to-create-the-beam-at"
	calculate_emit = False          ! Calculate emittances and other lattice parameters.
	! beam_init is of type beam_init_struct
	beam_init%n_particle = 100      ! Number of particles in a bunch.
	... etc...                      ! Set more beam_init parameters
/

The twiss parameters at the lattice element are used to shape the distribution of the beam
particles. If calculate_emit is set to True, emittances are calculated from the lattice and these
emittance values can be used in place of specifying the emittances by setting the appropriate
beam_init parameters.
