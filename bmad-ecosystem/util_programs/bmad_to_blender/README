Documentation for bmad_to_blender
---------------------------------

The conversion is a two step process:

1) Run the bmad_to_blender program to create a data file with the appropriate lattice information.
2) Use the blender_base.py script to create a blender file.

Status: Development has stopped due to lack of interest. The blender_base.py script was moved to the
directory bmad/old avoid accidental use. If you are interested in helping development, please
contact David Sagan.
